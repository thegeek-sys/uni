The Quine–Putnam indispensability argument reasons that we should believe in
abstract mathematical objects such as numbers and sets because mathematics is
indispensable to science. One of the most important ideas in the philosophy
of mathematics, it is credited to W. V. Quine and Hilary Putnam (pictured).
The roots of the argument can be traced back to thinkers such as Gottlob 
Frege and Kurt Gödel, but Quine introduced its key components, including 
naturalism and confirmational holism. Putnam gave Quine's argument its first
detailed formulation, although he later expressed disagreement with some
aspects of the argument. Many counterarguments have been raised against the
idea. An influential argument by Hartry Field holds that mathematical entities
are dispensable to science. Other philosophers, such as Penelope Maddy, have
argued that we do not need to believe in all of the entities that are
indispensable to science.
