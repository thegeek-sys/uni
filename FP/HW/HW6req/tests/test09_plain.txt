Machine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence
concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms
that can effectively generalize and thus perform tasks without
explicit instructions. Recently, generative artificial neural
networks have been able to surpass many previous approaches in
performance. Machine learning approaches have been applied to
large language models, computer vision, speech recognition, email
filtering, agriculture and medicine, where it is too costly to develop
algorithms to perform the needed tasks.

The mathematical foundations of ML are provided by mathematical
optimization (mathematical programming) methods. Data mining is a
related (parallel) field of study, focusing on exploratory data
analysis through unsupervised learning.

ML is known in its application across business problems under the name
predictive analytics. Although not all machine learning is
statistically based, computational statistics is an important source
of the field's methods.
